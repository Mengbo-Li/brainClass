Description: The brainclass R package is a toolkit that performs transcriptional
    -data-guided fMRI network classification to link connectome with the brain
    transcriptome. Via the strategic construction of feature groups which
    incorporates biologically meaningful gene set information such as biological
    pathways or gene ontology terms, the brainclass framework links predictive
    functional connectivity features with the potentially involved biological
    pathways, to bridge the gap between the functional biomarkers of
    neurological disorders and their underpinning molecular mechanisms.
    In addition, we also provide a post-hoc interpretation framework to enable
    biologically meaningful interpretation for the functional edge selection
    results by other existing fMRI network classification algorithms. The
    proposed methods can be easily applied to task-based fMRI data, and the
    selection of brain parcellation for brain network construction is entirely
    flexible.
